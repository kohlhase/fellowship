lemma "A | B ==> (B ==> C) ==> A | C"
proof -
 assume ab: "A | B"
 assume bc: "B ==> C"
 show "A | C"
 proof -
  from ab show ?thesis proof
    assume IH: "A" -- CSCboh
    from IH have a: "A" .
    from a show ?thesis ..
  next
    assume IH: "B" --CSCboh
    from IH have b: "B" .
    from bc b have c: "C" .
    from c show ?thesis ..
