// Fellowship :: version 0.1.0
// Released May 27th, 2005
// Installation intructions.

1. Make sure you have the O'Caml compiler installed, and that its version
   number is at least 3.08 (typing "ocamlc -v" can help you with that). 

2. Untar the fellowship-0.1.0.tar.gz package in you directory of choice:
    "tar zxvf fellowship-0.1.0.tar.gz"

3. Change directory to the newly created directory. Type "make" to compile
   the executable. This creates a binary file named "fsp". 
   
If you just want to play around / develop with Fellowship's sequent calculus,
you are set: skip to point 5. If you want to be able to export proofs in Coq
and PVS, you need to go through 4 before.

4a. (Optional) Install Coq. Make sure you have an environment variable COQBIN
   pointing to the directory containing the "coqtop" executable (use "which
   coqtop" to locate that baby, and "export
   COQBIN=/the/path/of/coqtops/parent/dir/" to set the environment variable).

4b. (Optional) Install PVS. Install the Prooflite library which can be found 
   at "http://research.nianet.org/~munoz/ProofLite/". As for Coq, set a
   PVSBIN variable to point to the parent directory of the "proveit"
   executable.

4c. (Optional) Type "make tests" to compile the regression tests and make sure
   your installation is complete. You will need to have Coq installed for
   this.

5. Type "./fsp" to launch fellowship... and off you go!
